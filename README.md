# Clustering Neural Signals Related to Cytokine Activity

Neural recordings data as well as raw MATLAB code availible at: 
<public.feinsteininstitute.org/cbem/PNAS%20Submission>.

## Steps in workflow:

Raw input-file.plx --[Preprocess (1)]--> waveforms & timestamps .mat files --[Preprocess (2)]-->  waveforms & timestamps .npy files --[VAE-training (3)]--> keras.Model 
--[ pdf GD (4)]--> high prob. data-points --[Clustering (5)]--> labeled data --[Event-rate (6)]--> Result that can be infered. 

* (1) : MATLAB preprocessing of raw recording. Includes "adaptive threshold" and romoval of "bad"-datapoints based on cardiac events etc. 

* (2) : Python preprocessing to have optimal form of input to VAE. qqq: Standardisation/frequency-domain ...?

* (3) : Build VAE model to achieve approximate probability model -- variational inference approach. Latent representa
tion of data etc. 

* (4) : Preform gradient decent on $$ \pi $$
* (5) : 

* (6) :

$$Â \pi $$
## Code structure

Only file to be called is main_first.py

Source Tree is as follows:
qqqq: TODO


OBS. main reads matlab files currently assumed to be in a folder "matlab_files" one step back in pwd.
